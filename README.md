# ScalaQuest Final Reports

![CI](https://github.com/scalaquest/Reports/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

This is the entry point for PPS and LSS reports. We decided to set them in a
separate repository, as the structure of them begun to rise in complexity.

## How to consult reports?

You can examine the reports from the
[PPS report website](https://scalaquest.github.io/Reports/reports/pps.html),
[LSS report website](https://scalaquest.github.io/Reports/reports/lss.html), in
[LaTeX PDF](https://github.com/scalaquest/Reports/releases/latest) format, or
directly from the
[Markdown files](https://github.com/scalaquest/Reports/tree/main/src/markdown).
