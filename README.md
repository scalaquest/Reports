# ScalaQuest Final Reports

![Reports Generation](https://github.com/scalaquest/reports/workflows/Reports%20Generation/badge.svg?branch=main)
![Markdown lint](https://github.com/scalaquest/reports/workflows/Markdown%20lint/badge.svg?branch=main)

This is the entry point for PPS and LSS reports. We decided to set them in a
separate repository, as the structure of them begun to rise in complexity.

You can consult reports and other project documentation, either in
[Markdown](./src/markdown), in a LaTeX
[PDF](https://github.com/scalaquest/reports/releases/) of from the
[web version](https://scalaquest.github.io/reports).
