## Let's start

Initially, you are in Vermilion City.
Inspecting the room there is a sleeping snorlax.
`inspect bag` will tell there are a pikachu, a pokeball, a pokeflute.

Snorlax is sleeping and blocking the way, but `wake snorlax` would be ineffective
and lead you to death. So, the pokeflute may be useful...

`play the pokeflute` or `wake snorlax with pokeflute` allows you to have the free way,
going north with `go n` and moving into the forest.

There is a Charizard into the forest! You should capture it!

With `catch charizard with pokeball` it could happen, but at first time it is too strong,
and in that case it would fly away.

This means it's Pikachu's turn!

`attack charizard with pikachu` is very effective, so don't do it again, or Charizard will die!

Now `catch charizard with pokeball` will work and let you win the match!
