# How to play this game?

In the following lines there is shown a little guide
for playing this example, explaining the steps to do
in order to win the match.

After have red the initial message shown at the beginning,
it's always recommended to type the command `inspect` and send it
pressing the Enter button. Furthermore, this command is
essential to understand the environment design and content.

About sentences, articles are always optional,
and adjectives also but just if there aren't ambiguity.
## Let's start

Initially, you are in a basement.
Inspecting the room there is:
- a *brown chest*
- an *iron hatch*
- a *rusty heavy crowbar*

You may try the command `open the hatch with the crowbar`,
but it will be ineffective.
Sending `open the chest` will open it, without needing a chest
key.
An `old rusty key` will appear in the room.
Now the command `open the hatch with the key` will work and you can go in the
living room using `go u`,`go up` or `enter the hatch`.
Now you can go in the bathroom using `go north`, but it will
contain nothing! So go back, and you may want to eat an apple...
but which?
`Eat red apple` will be a tasty action, while `eat the green apple`
will bring in a sad ending, because is poisoned.
Anyway, there is a big doorway, which is locked, so it needs
some tool, like the chest previously. So, neither `open the doorway`
nor `open doorway with key`, because it's not avalaible anymore.
Going back in the basement, there is a crowbar (maybe will be effective?).
`go down` and `take crowbar ` will bring it in your bag, as you can
see with `inspect bag`. This allows you to move the object in another room.
Go up again and `open the doorway with crowbar`
will let you win.
