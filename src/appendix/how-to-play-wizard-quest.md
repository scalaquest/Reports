# How to play this game?

In the following lines there is shown a little guide for playing this example,
explaining the steps to do in order to win the match.

After have red the initial message shown at the beginning, it's always
recommended to type the command `inspect` and send it pressing the Enter button.
Furthermore, this command is essential to understand the environment design and
content.

About sentences, articles are always optional, and adjectives also but just if
there aren't ambiguity.

## Let's start

You are Harry Potter. And probably in the worst situation. Inspecting the room,
you discover that you are in the Chamber of Secrets, with Tom Riddle in the
front of you.

Tom has been subjugated a terrible basilisk and the poor Ginny Weasley is lying
in the ground. Fortunately the basilisk is blind, but you don't have any weapon
to kill it.

You have to run away, through a tunnel in direction East with the command
`go east`. The basilisk follows your sound and you can't return to the Chamber.

With `inspect` you notice that there's a little stone in the ground behind you.
`throw the stone` to distract the basilisk. Now you can go back to the Chamber
with `go west`.

But the terrible basilisk is following you, so you have to find a sword or
something else to kill it! In the Chamber there is the sorting hat and
`look inside the hat` to find what you need.

Now `kill the basilisk with the gryffindor sword`!

The problems aren't over! Now you have to destroy Tom Riddle for ever (or
better, until next film). The basilisk hurts you and a tooth of the basilisk
remains in your arm. To kill Tom you have to `destroy the diary with the tooth`.
